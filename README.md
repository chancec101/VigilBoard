VigilBoard is a program that will scan for vulnerabilties on a system and it will generate a report of ways that the system can be better defended. The goal is to inform those who use the tool how best to defend their systems, despite being outdated.

VigilBoard is more geared towards healthcare database systems that may not be updated to their current version.

VigilBoard is a Cybersecurity Capstone collaborative effort between Chance Currie, William Mahoney, Issac Bamidele and David Abbot.
