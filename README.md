---About VigilBoard--- (expected completion date: May 2024)

VigilBoard is a program that will scan for vulnerabilties on a system and it will generate a report of those vulnerabilities in a more readable format with hyperlinks going to the Vulners database for more information on the found vulnerability. The goal is to inform those who use the tool how best to defend their systems, even if they don't have full security and/or technical knowledge.
VigilBoard is more geared towards websites, servers, or host systems that have detectable vulnerabilities, such as outdated services running on open ports that can be exploited.
VigilBoard was created by following the Unclassified DevSecOpsTools Fundamentals Guidebook PDF file found on this repository in order to ensure secure coding practices are employed and to ensure proper security at every phase throughout the software development lifecycle.
